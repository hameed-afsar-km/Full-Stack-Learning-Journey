## 📌 Overview

This repository documents **Day 5 of my Full-Stack Web Development learning journey**, where I focused on revising and strengthening my understanding of **core and intermediate JavaScript concepts** through **interactive, exhibition-style demonstrations**.

The objective of this day was to move beyond theory and **visually explore how JavaScript behaves**, how data flows, and how user interactions are handled using **pure JavaScript without frameworks**.

This marks the completion of my **JavaScript fundamentals and intermediate-level revision**, preparing me for deeper topics like advanced JavaScript patterns and React.
