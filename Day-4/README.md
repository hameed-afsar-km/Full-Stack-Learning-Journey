## 📌 Overview

This repository documents **Day 4 of my Full-Stack Web Development learning journey**, where I focused on **CSS animations, visual effects, and interaction-based styling concepts** as part of **freeCodeCamp’s Full-Stack curriculum**.

The goal of this day was to understand **how motion, effects, and user interactions are handled purely with CSS**, and how these features enhance **user experience, visual feedback, and UI polish** in real-world applications.

With this day, I have now **completed a full revision of all core and important CSS fundamentals**, from basic styling to layouts, animations, and interactions.
